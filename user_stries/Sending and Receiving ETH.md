**Detailed User Stories for "Sending and Receiving ETH" Functionality**

---

This document provides detailed user stories, technical specifications, implementation details, and acceptance criteria for the "Sending and Receiving ETH" functionality of the Web3 Wallet Chrome Extension. The stories are divided into logical pieces to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness. Additionally, the connection and data flow between the **Wallet Setup** step and the **Sending and Receiving ETH** step are explained to provide a complete understanding of the process.

---

### **Connection and Data Flow Between Wallet Setup and Sending/Receiving ETH**

1. **Wallet Setup Completion**: After the user completes the **Wallet Setup** (creating a new wallet or importing an existing one), the system generates or imports the seed phrase and derives the user's wallet address and private key.

2. **Data Encryption and Storage**: The seed phrase and private key are encrypted using the user's password and stored securely in the browser's local storage.

3. **State Initialization**: The wallet address, balance, and transaction history are initialized in the application's state management system (Redux store).

4. **Access to Wallet Functions**: With the wallet set up, the user can now access functionalities like viewing their wallet address for receiving ETH and initiating transactions to send ETH.

5. **Data Flow Overview**:
   - **Receiving ETH**: The user's wallet address is displayed using data from the Redux store, allowing others to send ETH to this address.
   - **Sending ETH**: When sending ETH, the private key is retrieved (and decrypted in-memory) to sign transactions securely.

### **Implementation Connections Between Wallet Setup and Sending/Receiving ETH**

1. **Data Initialization**:
   - **Wallet Setup** initializes the user's wallet address and encrypted private key in the Redux store and local storage.
   - **Sending/Receiving ETH** relies on this data to function properly.

2. **Private Key Usage**:
   - During **Sending ETH**, the private key is decrypted (using the user's password) to sign transactions.
   - Secure handling ensures the key is only available in-memory temporarily and is not exposed elsewhere.

3. **Address Display**:
   - The wallet address obtained during **Wallet Setup** is used in **Receiving ETH** to generate the QR code and display the address.

4. **State Management**:
   - The Redux store acts as a single source of truth, holding the wallet information after setup and throughout the application's lifecycle.

5. **Security Flow**:
   - **Wallet Setup** enforces security by encrypting sensitive data.
   - **Sending ETH** continues this practice by handling decryption securely and ensuring the user's assets are protected during transactions.

6. **User Authentication**:
   - Users may be required to re-enter their password or authenticate biometrically before sending ETH, leveraging the security measures established during **Wallet Setup**.

---

**Summary**

These user stories and associated details provide a clear roadmap for implementing the **Sending and Receiving ETH** functionalities. By following the technical specifications and ensuring the acceptance criteria are met, developers can create a seamless and secure user experience that integrates tightly with the initial **Wallet Setup** process. This approach ensures that all aspects of sending and receiving ETH are handled with the necessary attention to detail, security, and usability.
