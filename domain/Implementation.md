  - Implement a permission prompt when a DApp requests access.
  - Allow users to approve or reject connection requests.
- **Connected DApps Management:**
  - Provide a settings page where users can view and revoke DApp permissions.

### 3.5 Security Features

- **Authentication:**
  - Implement biometric authentication using the Web Authentication API where available.
  - Ensure the wallet locks after a period of inactivity.
- **Encryption:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data (private keys, seed phrases) using AES-256-GCM.
  - Derive encryption keys from the user's password using PBKDF2 with a high iteration count and unique salt.

### 3.6 Customization and Settings

- **Background Service Worker:**
  - Implement background functionality using service workers as per Manifest V3.

### 7.2 Communication Between Scripts

- **Messaging System:**
  - Use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage` for communication between popup, background, and content scripts.
- **Event Handling:**
  - Ensure proper handling of asynchronous events and responses.

---

## Step 8: Perform Thorough Testing

### 8.1 Unit Testing

- **Write Tests for All Functions:**
